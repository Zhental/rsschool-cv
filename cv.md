## About me
####    Hi! I'm 22 years old, and I'm from Belarus. I've been trying to enter IT sinse February 2022. I was learning Python before, majored in BackEnd. Then desided to try JavaScript and FrontEnd developmenl. Hopefully it'll be easier to me to step in it from such side, knowing python's syntax. I have no IT work experiense, but have some in my specialization from the University. I have many good recommendations from last jobs about my cleverness and responsibility, so I think, my future employer will be happy to have me. As for me, I just like to cope with different puzzles.
## Skills
* HTML, CSS
* Python
* SQL, MySQL
* Git, GitHub
* JavaScript basics


## Code example
```
let friend1 = {
firstname : "Jack",
lastname : "White",
weight : 79,
height : 1.7,
calculateBMI : function () {
    this.BMI = this.weight/(this.height**2);
    return this.BMI;
    }
}

console.log(friend1.calculateBMI());

let friend2 = {
    firstname : "Mike",
    lastname : "Black",
    weight : 91,
    height : 1.93,
    calculateBMI : function () {
        this.BMI = this.weight/(this.height**2);
        return this.BMI;
    }
}

console.log(friend2.calculateBMI());

if (friend1.BMI > friend2.BMI) {
    console.log(`${friend1.firstname} ${friend1.lastname} BMI (${friend1.BMI}) is higher than ${friend2.firstname} ${friend2.lastname}(${friend2.BMI})!`);
} else if (friend1.BMI < friend2.BMI) {
    console.log(`${friend2.firstname} ${friend2.lastname} BMI (${friend2.BMI}) is higher than ${friend1.firstname} ${friend1.lastname}(${friend1.BMI})!`);
}
